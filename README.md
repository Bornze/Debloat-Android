A script that uninstall all samsung bloatware and proprietary stock apps and replace them with foss alternatives using adb


<h2> So what does this tool does ? </h2>
 This tool basically uses adb and uninstall all the bloatware found in samsung devices including gapps and replace all of them
 with FOSS alternatives taken directly from F-Droid store.It also replace stock apps like phone,camera,messages etc with foss apps 
 like simple dialer, simple camera, QKSMS and more.

<h2> Why I created this tool ? </h2>
 In modern world we are constantly surrounded by the big five known as GAFAM (Google,Amazon.Facebook,Apple,Microsoft) and hence
 our online privacy is somewhere on the verge of extinction and our smartphones are those spy tools use big corporations and
 government to profile us and sell our data to third party advertisers. So I made this tool which uses adb aka Android Debugging Bridge 
 to uninstall system apps including bloatware and other google and facebook tracking stuff and giving you a fresh clean slate while
 retaining your device security model as bootloader is not touched. So You get great security + Decent privacy. So this tools allows
 beginners and pro users to simply debloat and install foss apps on their device that respects their <strong> privacy </strong>
 automatically.
